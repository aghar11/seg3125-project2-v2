                        <Accordion.Body>
                        To grip a golf club correctly, start by placing the club in your non-dominant hand (left hand for right-handed golfers, right hand for left-handed golfers) with the club's grip resting diagonally across your fingers. Wrap your fingers around the grip, ensuring that your palm is facing towards your target. Next, place your dominant hand below your non-dominant hand, overlapping or interlocking your fingers. Maintain a light but secure grip, making sure not to grip the club too tightly. This grip provides stability and control throughout your swing.

                        <Accordion.Body>
                        Proper stance and posture are crucial for a successful golf swing. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and your weight evenly distributed on both feet. Bend your knees slightly and maintain a straight back. Your upper body should tilt slightly forward from the hips, ensuring that your spine remains straight and your chin is up. Your arms should hang naturally, and your hands should be positioned slightly ahead of the ball. This balanced and athletic posture will help you generate power and maintain control during your swing.

                        <Accordion.Body>
                        While the rules of golf can be extensive, here are a few key basics:<br/><br/>
                        - Each player should play their own ball and keep track of their own score.<br/>
                        - Players should be respectful of others on the course, maintaining proper etiquette and pace of play.<br/>
                        - Golfers should take care of the course, repairing divots, raking bunkers, and adhering to any course-specific rules.<br/>
                        - Players should not disturb others while they are preparing or taking their shots.<br/>
                        - It's important to know and follow the local rules of the course you are playing on.<br/>
                        - Familiarize yourself with the rules regarding out-of-bounds, hazards, and penalties.

                        <Accordion.Header>Which clubs should I use for different shots on the course?</Accordion.Header>
                        <Accordion.Body>
                        While the choice of clubs may vary depending on individual playing style and course conditions, here are the general guidelines:<br/><br/>
                        - Driver: Typically used for long-distance shots off the tee.<br/>
                        - Fairway Woods: Used for long shots from the fairway or rough, particularly when the ball is sitting well above the ground.<br/>
                        - Irons: Numbered from 3 to 9, irons are versatile clubs used for shots of varying distances. Lower-numbered irons are used for longer shots, while higher-numbered irons are used for shorter, more controlled shots.<br/>
                        - Wedges: Includes pitching wedge, sand wedge, and lob wedge. Wedges are designed for short shots near or around the green, helping to control trajectory and spin.<br/>
                        - Putter: Used on the green to roll the ball into the hole. Putters have a flat face and are designed for accuracy and control.<br/><br/>
                        Experiment with different clubs during practice sessions to understand how each one performs for various shots. As you gain experience, you'll develop a better sense of which club to use in different situations on the course.
